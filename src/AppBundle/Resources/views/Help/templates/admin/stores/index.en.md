Stores
-------

The `Stores` are the shops which have a delivery contract with the co-op. A `Tarification` is assigned to each `Store`. It is used to calculate the price for each delivery.  

### Store creation (admin only)

You need to be admin to create `Stores`. In the admin panel, click on `Store` then on the `Add a store` button. Afterwards you will be able to access to existing `Stores` from this page. On each `Store` page you will be able to edit it or to create a `Delivery` for this store.  

To assign a `Store` to an `User`, go on the user profile from the `Users` tab of the admin panel. If the `User` has the role `Store` you will be able to assign `Store` to him.

### Manage stores

If you have the role `Store`, you can manage the `Stores` you own and create `Deliveries`. Click on `My Account` in the top-right dropdown. From the stores list click on `Manage` on the right.
